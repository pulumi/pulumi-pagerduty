        /// A Unix timestamp in milliseconds which is combined with the `timezone` to determine the time this rule will start on each specified `weekday`. Note that the *date* of the timestamp you specify does **not** matter, except that it lets you determine whether daylight saving time is in effect so that you use the correct UTC offset for the timezone you specify. In practice, you may want to use the `time_static` resource to generate this value, as demonstrated in the `resource.pagerduty_ruleset_rule.foo` code example at the top of this page. To generate this timestamp manually, if you want your rule to apply starting at 9:30am in the `America/New_York` timezone, use your programing language of choice to determine a Unix timestamp that represents 9:30am in that timezone, like [1554989400000](https://www.epochconverter.com/timezones?q=1554989400000&amp;tz=America%2FNew_York).
