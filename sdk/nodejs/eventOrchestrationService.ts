/**
 * A [Service Orchestration](https://support.pagerduty.com/docs/event-orchestration#service-orchestrations) allows you to create a set of Event Rules. The Service Orchestration evaluates Events sent to this Service against each of its rules, beginning with the rules in the "start" set. When a matching rule is found, it can modify and enhance the event and can route the event to another set of rules within this Service Orchestration for further processing.
 *
 * > If you have a Service that uses [Service Event Rules](https://support.pagerduty.com/docs/rulesets#service-event-rules), you can switch to [Service Orchestrations](https://support.pagerduty.com/docs/event-orchestration#service-orchestrations) at any time setting the attribute `enableEventOrchestrationForService` to `true`. Please read the [Switch to Service Orchestrations](https://support.pagerduty.com/docs/event-orchestration#switch-to-service-orchestrations) instructions for more information.
 *
 * ## Example of configuring a Service Orchestration
 *
 * This example shows creating `Team`, `User`, `Escalation Policy`, and `Service` resources followed by creating a Service Orchestration to handle Events sent to that Service.
 *
 * This example also shows using the pagerduty.getPriority and pagerduty.EscalationPolicy data sources to configure `priority` and `escalationPolicy` actions for a rule.
 *
 * This example shows a Service Orchestration that has nested sets: a rule in the "start" set has a `routeTo` action pointing at the "step-two" set.
 *
 * The `catchAll` actions will be applied if an Event reaches the end of any set without matching any rules in that set. In this example the `catchAll` doesn't have any `actions` so it'll leave events as-is.
