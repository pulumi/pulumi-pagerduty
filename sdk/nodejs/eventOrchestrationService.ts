/**
 * A [Service Orchestration](https://support.pagerduty.com/docs/event-orchestration#service-orchestrations) allows you to create a set of Event Rules. The Service Orchestration evaluates Events sent to this Service against each of its rules, beginning with the rules in the "start" set. When a matching rule is found, it can modify and enhance the event and can route the event to another set of rules within this Service Orchestration for further processing.
 *
 * > If you have a Service that uses [Service Event Rules](https://support.pagerduty.com/docs/rulesets#service-event-rules), you can switch to [Service Orchestrations](https://support.pagerduty.com/docs/event-orchestration#service-orchestrations) at any time setting the attribute `enableEventOrchestrationForService` to `true`. Please read the [Switch to Service Orchestrations](https://support.pagerduty.com/docs/event-orchestration#switch-to-service-orchestrations) instructions for more information.
 *
 * ## Import
 *
 * Service Orchestration can be imported using the `id` of the Service, e.g.
 *
 * ```sh
 *  $ pulumi import pagerduty:index/eventOrchestrationService:EventOrchestrationService service PFEODA7
 * ```
