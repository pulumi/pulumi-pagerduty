/**
 * An Unrouted Orchestration allows users to create a set of Event Rules that will be evaluated against all events that don't match any rules in the Orchestration's Router.
 *
 * The Unrouted Orchestration evaluates events sent to it against each of its rules, beginning with the rules in the "start" set. When a matching rule is found, it can modify and enhance the event and can route the event to another set of rules within this Unrouted Orchestration for further processing.
 *
 * ## Example of configuring Unrouted Rules for an Orchestration
 *
 * In this example of an Unrouted Orchestration, the rule matches only if the condition is matched.
 * Alerts created for events that do not match the rule will have severity level set to `info` as defined in `catchAll` block.
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as pagerduty from "@pulumi/pagerduty";
 *
 * const unrouted = new pagerduty.EventOrchestrationUnrouted("unrouted", {
 *     eventOrchestration: myMonitor.id,
 *     sets: [{
 *         id: "start",
 *         rules: [{
 *             label: "Update the summary of un-matched Critical alerts so they're easier to spot",
 *             conditions: [{
 *                 expression: "event.severity matches 'critical'",
 *             }],
 *             actions: {
 *                 severity: "critical",
 *                 extractions: [{
 *                     target: "event.summary",
 *                     template: "[Critical Unrouted] {{event.summary}}",
 *                 }],
 *             },
 *         }],
 *     }],
 *     catchAll: {
 *         actions: {
 *             severity: "info",
 *         },
 *     },
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * ## Import
 *
 * Unrouted Orchestration can be imported using the `id` of the Event Orchestration, e.g.
 *
 * ```sh
 * $ pulumi import pagerduty:index/eventOrchestrationUnrouted:EventOrchestrationUnrouted unrouted 1b49abe7-26db-4439-a715-c6d883acfb3e
 * ```
