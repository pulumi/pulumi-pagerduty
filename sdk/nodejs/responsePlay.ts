/**
 * A [response play](https://developer.pagerduty.com/api-reference/b3A6Mjc0ODE2Ng-create-a-response-play) allows you to create packages of Incident Actions that can be applied during an Incident's life cycle.
 *
 * <div role="alert" class="alert alert-warning">
 *   <div class="alert-title"><i class="fa fa-warning"></i>End-of-Life</div>
 *   <p>
 *     Response Play will end-of-life soon. We highly recommend that you

 *       href="https://support.pagerduty.com/docs/upgrade-response-plays-to-incident-workflows"
 *       rel="noopener noreferrer"
 *       target="_blank"
 *       >migrate to Incident Workflows</a>
 *     as soon as possible so you can take advantage of the new functionality.
 *     With Incident Workflows, customers are able to define if-this-then-that
 *     logic to effortlessly trigger a sequence of common incident actions, advanced conditions, REST APIs
 *     and Terraform support.

 *
 * ## Example Usage
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as pagerduty from "@pulumi/pagerduty";
 *
 * const example = new pagerduty.User("example", {
 *     name: "Earline Greenholt",
 *     email: "125.greenholt.earline@graham.name",
 *     teams: [examplePagerdutyTeam.id],
 * });
 * const exampleEscalationPolicy = new pagerduty.EscalationPolicy("example", {
 *     name: "Engineering Escalation Policy",
 *     numLoops: 2,
 *     rules: [{
 *         escalationDelayInMinutes: 10,
 *         targets: [{
 *             type: "user",
 *             id: example.id,
 *         }],
 *     }],
 * });
 * const exampleResponsePlay = new pagerduty.ResponsePlay("example", {
 *     name: "My Response Play",
 *     from: example.email,
 *     responders: [{
 *         type: "escalation_policy_reference",
 *         id: exampleEscalationPolicy.id,
 *     }],
 *     subscribers: [{
 *         type: "user_reference",
 *         id: example.id,
 *     }],
 *     runnability: "services",
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * ## Import
 *
 * Response Plays can be imported using the `id.from(email)`, e.g.
 *
 * ```sh
 * $ pulumi import pagerduty:index/responsePlay:ResponsePlay main 16208303-022b-f745-f2f5-560e537a2a74.user@email.com
 * ```
